      Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous
      A good example is JavaScript setTimeout() Asynchronous JavaScript The
      examples used in the previous chapter, was very simplified. The purpose of
      the examples was to demonstrate the syntax of callback functions:
    </p>
  </body>
  <script>
    console.log("hello ");
    console.log("Every one");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("My name is Uzair Khan");
      
    }, 5000);
    console.log("age 22");
    
    
  </script>
</html>
