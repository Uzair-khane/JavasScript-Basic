    <h1>async is a keyword in JavaScript used to write asynchronous code in an easy and clean way.</h1> <br>
    <h3>Normally, when you use functions like fetch() or setTimeout, JavaScript doesn't wait â€” it keeps running. That's asynchronous behavior. The async keyword helps you write such code more like normal, step-by-step code.</h3> <br>
    <p>
      "I will finish later!" <br />

      Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous
      A good example is JavaScript setTimeout() Asynchronous JavaScript The
      examples used in the previous chapter, was very simplified. The purpose of
      the examples was to demonstrate the syntax of callback functions:
    </p>
  </body>
  <script>
    console.log("hello ");
    console.log("Every one");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("My name is Uzair Khan");
      
    }, 5000);
    console.log("age 22");
    
    
  </script>
</html>
