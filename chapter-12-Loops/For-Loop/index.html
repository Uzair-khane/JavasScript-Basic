      The For Loop The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions: <br>
      for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) { // code block to be
      executed } <br>
      Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the
      code block. <br>
       Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code
      block. Expression 3 <br>
       is executed (every time) after the code block has been
      executed
